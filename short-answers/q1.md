# Question

What is the DOM and what does it stand for?

# Answer

The `document` object is the DOM packaged in an object. The properties of the object allow us to access various elements of the DOM. Each element is a node in the document tree and each node has a `.children` array. The DOM is a way for JavaScript to interact with the structure of web pages, allowing them to modify, add, or delete elements and content.
