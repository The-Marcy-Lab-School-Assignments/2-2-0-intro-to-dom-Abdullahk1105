# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

`.innerHTML` is quick for inserting complex HTML or working with HTML strings, but
`.createElement` offers better control, security, and performance, making it preferable for dynamic content and large-scale applications.
