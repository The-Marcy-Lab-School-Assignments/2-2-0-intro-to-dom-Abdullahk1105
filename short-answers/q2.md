# Question

Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

HTMLCollections are live collections, meaning they are automatically updated when the underlying document structure changes.A NodeList is a collection of nodes, including elements, text nodes, and other types of nodes, returned by methods like `querySelectorAll`. NodeList will not update automatically, like
HTMLCollections do. HTMLCollections and NodeLists are both arrays.
